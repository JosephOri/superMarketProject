# superMarketProject
# Background :
This project is meant to reorganize all the display areas in a specific supermarket and build a computerized system that will contain relevant
information about each product.
The system is intended to help calculate potential costs and profits, as well as assist in optimizing the store's layout.

<h3>In the store, there are three types of products defined:</h3>

Agricultural - Fruits and vegetables that are priced by weight.<br>
Dairy - Various dairy products sold in different packaging.<br>
Package - A bundle/package in which multiple different dairy products are sold. <br>
